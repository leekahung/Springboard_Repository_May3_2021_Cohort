# Case Study Big Mountain Resort

This project was made to find the "best valued" ticket prices for Big Mountain Resort as they wished to transition towards a more data-driven approach to their business strategy using the following <a href="https://github.com/leekahung/Springboard_Repository_May3_2021_Cohort/tree/main/DataScienceGuidedCapstone/raw_data">dataset</a>.

In this capstone, I've performed data wrangling tasks to provide a clean dataset to work with and exploratory data analysis which allowed us to identify what are the best possible approaches to creating our machine learning model.
